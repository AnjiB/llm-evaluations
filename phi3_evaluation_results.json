    "question": "Explain photosynthesis in simple terms.",
    "phi3_response": "Photosynthesis is the process plants use to make their own food. They take sunlight, water from the soil, and carbon dioxide from the air, mix them together using a green pigment called chlorophyll (found mostly in leaves), and produce glucose, which is sugar that gives energy for growth and development. Oxygen gets released as a byproduct of this process into the atmosphere \u2013 something we all need to breathe!",
    "reference_answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen.",
    "correctness_score": true,
    "hallucination_score": null,
    "correctness_reasoning": "The output provided a clear explanation of photosynthesis in simple terms that accurately included the key elements: light energy (sunlight), raw materials (water from soil, carbon dioxide from air) and products formed during this process (glucose for food/energy storage & oxygen as byproduct). While it used more detail than necessary \u2013 such as explaining 'green pigment' called chlorophyll - the overall explanation is factually accurate without misleading or ambiguous statements. It also correctly uses relevant terminology and maintains logical consistency throughout.",
